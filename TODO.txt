general:
	strip/replace character method so model doesnt have to be updated constantly
	log config
	unified Path/FileType -- rename from FileType
	argparse help descriptions
	readme
	clean generated files for fileid

dictionary:
	--save flag?

all:
	init from fileid & return generated/memoized alignments/decodings/etc

CorrectionShell:
	redirect log during cmdloop()
	currently !-prefix is required for selecting user input, is this desirable?
	docstrings
	get tokens from hocr also
	sort out memo/track/newwords
	proper split into (punct, word, punct) tuple instead of stripping punctuation so it can be put back after dictionary lookup

decoder:
	better name (tokenize?)
