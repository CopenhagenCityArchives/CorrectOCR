general:
	strip/replace character method so model doesnt have to be updated constantly
	log config
	argparse help descriptions
	readme
	clean generated files for fileid

dictionary:
	--save flag?

all:
	init from fileid & return generated/memoized alignments/decodings/etc

CorrectionShell:
	redirect log during cmdloop()
	currently !-prefix is required for selecting user input, is this desirable?
	docstrings
	get tokens from hocr also
	proper split into (punct, word, punct) tuple instead of stripping punctuation so it can be put back after dictionary lookup

decoder:
	better name (tokenize?)
